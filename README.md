   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd asset-management-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Supabase**
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Copy your project URL and anon key
   - Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
   - Add your Supabase credentials

4. **Run database migrations**
   - Go to the Supabase SQL editor
   - Copy and run the SQL from `Supabase/schema.sql`

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Create your first user**
   - Visit the application
   - Sign up with your email
   - Choose your role (HOD, Lab Incharge, Lab Assistant, or Faculty)
   - Provide your lab ID

## Development Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Database Schema

### Tables
- `user_profiles`: User metadata with roles (HOD, Lab Incharge, Lab Assistant, Faculty) and lab assignments
- `labs`: Lab information with unique identifiers and location tracking
- `assets`: Main asset inventory with approval workflow, automatic asset ID generation, and comprehensive tracking
- `asset_issues`: Issue tracking and resolution with cost estimation and status management
- `asset_transfers`: Lab-to-lab asset transfers with multi-level approval process
- `notifications`: Real-time notifications for system events and user actions
- `activity_logs`: Comprehensive audit trail with severity levels and metadata

### Key Features
- **Automatic Asset ID Generation**: Assets get unique IDs based on lab identifier and asset type
- **Multi-level Approval Workflow**: Assets require Lab Incharge and HOD approval
- **Real-time Notifications**: Automated notifications for all system activities
- **Activity Logging**: Full audit trail with JSON diff tracking for changes
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Enabled on all tables with role-based policies
- **Automatic Timestamps**: Created/updated timestamps on all tables
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Proper referential integrity across all tables
